## Motivation
Cryptocurrency is an up and coming technology that has the power to change the way we record and interact with data. As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I wanted an app that can display the most vital information (e.g., price, market-cap, 24-hour percent change), latest headlines, and any relevant videos related to that asset in one place. As a result, the idea of a daily crypto dashboard was born.
